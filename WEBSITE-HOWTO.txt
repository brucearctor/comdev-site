How to publish the community.apache.org website
====

Instructions for modifying https://community.apache.org/ , with minimal use of the Apache CMS:

 * Checkout https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/comdev/site/trunk
 * Edit under ./content
 * On commit, build runs at https://ci.apache.org/builders/community-site-staging , any build errors are reported there
 * Content is staged under http://community.staging.apache.org/
 * Use https://cms.apache.org/community/publish?diff=1 to check diffs and publish changes. Quite often, this includes changes made by others which haven't been published.

Notifications are sent to (at least) https://lists.apache.org/list.html?commits@community.apache.org
